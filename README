AnnoCPAN-Perldoc version 0.10
=============================

AnnoCPAN is a web interface for the documentation of all the modules on CPAN,
where users can add annotations on the margin of specific paragraphs throughout
the POD. The master AnnoCPAN site is located at http://annocpan.org/.

AnnoCPAN-Perldoc provides a substitute for the 'perldoc' command that displays
the annotations locally and without requiring a connection to the Internet. 
It works by using a local note database that can be downloaded from

    http://annocpan.org/annopod.db

This is an SQLite3 database; the file should be saved in one of these
locations:

$HOME
$USERPROFILE
$ALLUSERSPROFILE
/var/annocpan

It can also be called .annopod.db, to hide it in Unix-like systems. It is your
resposibility to keep this file as up-to-date as you want. Future versions may
include an automatic update feature (which will require network connectivity).
