=head1 DESCRIPTION

The C<annopod> program works exactly the same as L<perldoc>, except that it
looks for a local annotation database and inserts the annotations just before
rendering the POD.

It works by using a local note database that can be downloaded from

    http://annocpan.org/annopod.db

This is an SQLite3 database; the file should be saved in one of these
locations:

$HOME
$USERPROFILE
$ALLUSERSPROFILE
/var/annocpan

It can also be called .annopod.db, to hide it in Unix-like systems. It is your
resposibility to keep this file as up-to-date as you want. Future versions may
include an automatic update feature (which will require network connectivity).
